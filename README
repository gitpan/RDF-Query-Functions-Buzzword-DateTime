DESCRIPTION
    This is a plugin for RDF::Query providing a number of extension
    functions for dates and times.

    *   http://buzzword.org.uk/2011/functions/datetime#add

        Given an xsd:dateTime or xsd:date, and an xsd:duration, adds the
        duration to the datetime. Returns an xsd:date if it was passed an
        xsd:date and the xsd:duration didn't specify any hours, minutes or
        seconds. Returns an xsd:dateTime otherwise.

    *   http://buzzword.org.uk/2011/functions/datetime#difference

        Given two xsd:dateTime or xsd:date literals, returns an xsd:duration
        representing the difference between them.

    *   http://buzzword.org.uk/2011/functions/datetime#format_duration

        Given an xsd:duration and a literal formatting string, returns a
        formatted duration. See DateTime::Format::Duration.

    *   http://buzzword.org.uk/2011/functions/datetime#now

        Returns the current xsd:dateTime, with supposed nanosecond
        precision. If called multiple times in the same SPARQL query, will
        always return the same instant.

    *   http://buzzword.org.uk/2011/functions/datetime#strftime

        Takes a xsd:datetime and a literal formatting string and returns a
        formattted date. See DateTime.

    *   http://buzzword.org.uk/2011/functions/datetime#strtodate

        Attempts to parse an arbitrary literal using natural language and
        convert it into an xsd:date. Smart enough to tell the difference
        between "1/6/1980"@en-us and "1/6/1980"@en-gb.

        Can safely be passed an existing xsd:date or xsd:dateTime.

    *   http://buzzword.org.uk/2011/functions/datetime#strtotime

        As per "strtodate" but returns an xsd:dateTime.

        "add", "difference" and "strftime" all implicitly call "strtotime"
        on their xsd:dateTime arguments, which means they don't need to be
        given strict xsd:date/dateTime input.

    *   http://buzzword.org.uk/2011/functions/datetime#today

        Like "now" but returns an xsd:date.
